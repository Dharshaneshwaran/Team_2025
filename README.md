# 🦍 Grateful Gorillas: The Premium Notes Experience

A high-end, immersive, and animated notes application built for the **Smart Learning Workshop 2025**. This project features a unique scroll-driven "paper-peel" journey through a 4-day curriculum, culminating in a cinematic finale.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📜 Scroll-Driven Paper Physics
Experience a tactile, reversible paper-peel animation. Every note in the stack reacts to your scroll, curling and lifting with realistic 3D transformations and dynamic shadows.

### 🎨 Thematic 4-Day Journey
The application shifts dynamically across four distinct visual states as you explore the content:
- **Day 1: Monochrome Foundation** – Clean, minimal, and focused.
- **Day 2: Sunset Warmth** – Peach tones with radiant glows and side progress tracking.
- **Day 3: Nature Flow** – Leafy green accents and growth-oriented aesthetics.
- **Day 4: Indigo Tech** – Blueprint-style grids and high-tech strategy vibes.

### 🎬 Mission Impossible Finale
A high-impact cinematic credits roll for the **2025 Team**. Features a scroll-driven "zig-zag" zoom effect that flies past the viewer with professional motion blur and scaling.

### 💎 Premium Aesthetic Polish
- **Custom Aura Cursor:** A blurring light aura that follows your mouse.
- **Film Grain Texture:** A subtle tactile noise overlay for a cinematic feel.
- **Dynamic Light Sheen:** Real-time reflections on paper surfaces during motion.
- **Themed Global Progress Bar:** A color-shifting indicator tracking your entire journey.
